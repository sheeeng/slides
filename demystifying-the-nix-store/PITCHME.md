# <!--fit--> Demystifying the Nix Store

The Giant Immutable LEGO® Set
Demystifying the Nix Store

<!--
Ever looked inside /nix/store and felt immediate confusion? You aren't alone. For many, the "magic" of Nix is hidden behind cryptic hashes and the mysterious "derivation." This talk strips away the jargon to explain how Nix actually works using a simple metaphor: a giant, immutable LEGO set. We’ll explore how Nix builds software in total isolation, why your system can’t "break" like traditional distros, and how every package is just a recipe waiting to be snapped into place.
